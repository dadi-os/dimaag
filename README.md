# Hath

Agent runtime for dadi. It owns agent identity, transcripts, the dual-lane loop, inter-agent messaging, and the audit log. Every model call goes to Dwar. Hath never talks to a provider. Unauthenticated; private mesh only.

## Dependencies

- Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`)
- Dwar at `http://dwar.dadi` for chat and image describe
- Yaad at `http://yaad.dadi` for memory tools
- Ghar at `http://ghar.dadi` for home device tools
- Chaavi at `http://chaavi.dadi` for vault tools (`chaavi_*`); secrets and passkey keys are never returned to the model
- Nas at `http://nas.dadi` for host terminals, project filesystem, and headed Chromium browsers (also mesh DNS / logging)
- `playwright-core` (no browser download — Chromium comes from Nas over CDP)

## Config vs env

`config.toml` (checked in): lane queue timeout, Dwar/Yaad/Ghar/Chaavi/Nas timeout and retry, browser action/navigation/snapshot limits.

Topology is hardcoded in `src/constants.ts`.

`DATABASE_URL` is required at startup (no empty default). Nas injects it in compose and on the appliance (`postgres://hath:hath@hath-postgres:5432/hath`). There is no Hath `.env` — Postgres is not Preferences-editable; `.env.example` documents the variables. `TZ` is required too and must be an IANA zone: it is the box's time zone, which Nas writes to `/var/lib/dadi/timezone.env` from `/etc/localtime` on every boot and the container loads with `EnvironmentFile=`; compose requires it in the shell.

## Local run

```sh
cd ../nas
docker compose up hath hath-postgres
docker compose run --rm hath npm run db:migrate
docker compose run --rm hath npm test
```

Migrations run schema SQL and sync the tool registry. They do not grant tools. The router is `POST /router`, not an agents row.

## CI / CD

| Workflow | When | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` → `ci` | PR + push to `main` | Postgres service, migrate, `npm test`, build images |
| `ci.yml` → `publish` | `main` after `ci` | Push `ghcr.io/<owner>/hath:{latest,sha}` |

## Logging / error codes

Logs follow the nas JSON contract (`service=hath`, request summary, `code` on errors). Default Fastify access logging is off.

HTTP errors: `{ "error": { "type": "<code>", "message": "..." } }`. Shared codes include `invalid_request`, `not_found`, `upstream_unreachable`, `internal_error`. Domain codes include `dwar`, `yaad`, `ghar`, `chaavi`, `vault_unconfigured`, `vault_unreachable`, `nas`, `conflict`, `stale_ref`. See nas README for the shared catalog (`busy`, `forbidden`, `binary_file`, …).

## Agents

Every `agents` row is an agent. The router is not a row — it is `POST /router`. Agent primary keys are immutable lowercase kebab-case ids (`browser-manager`); there is no separate name column. API responses still expose `name` as an alias of `id` for desktop/roster compat. Root agents have `parent_agent_id` null: they are the router's children. Nested workers point at a real parent. `GET /agents` includes ephemeral `running` (lane locks) and `sessions` (Nas browsers and terminals the agent recently drove). Spawn/list do not attach; worker tools that take `browser_id` or `terminal_id` do. Both maps die with the process.

## Router

`POST /router` is Dadi's translator: Ankur says what he wants, and the router picks the owner, writes the message he would send, and sends it as him; his app opens that thread when the agent answers. It is not an agent and not a conversation. The router is the null identity — the same as the user — so every message it sends lands in an agent's thread as `from_agent_id` null, written as Ankur. The router is ephemeral: it has no transcript and carries nothing between runs. Each request:

1. Writes an audit row (`agent_logs`, router lane, `message` / `receive`) holding the utterance. It is not stored as a message.
2. Runs the router lane: the same step loop as agent lanes, calling Dwar `POST /chat/complete` (context-free on Dwar's side). System is `prompts/system.md` + `prompts/router.md` + identity + the active root agents; messages are exactly one turn, this utterance (headed `[From: Ankur]`) — no earlier run, nothing sent as Ankur, no reply to him, and nothing that arrives mid-run. What is underway it finds with its tools. Nothing in code caps the loop; it ends when the model calls `yield`.
3. Returns `201 { messages: [{ to_agent_id, content, seq, created_at }] }` — every message it sent, in order (may be empty).

Router tools (hardcoded, not grants): `send_message` (deliver as Ankur; wakes a dormant recipient), `list_agents`, `recall_memory`, `hath_spawn_agent` (creates a root), and the embedded agent-management tools — `grant_tool` / `revoke_tool` on root agents only, `get_agent` / `get_logs` on any agent, `list_tools`. It cannot modify agents: agents reshape themselves. Its model turns and tool results log to `agent_logs` with a null `agent_id` on the `router` lane. The router's `get_logs` must name an agent; only the user (CLI, no `agent_id`) reads the null identity's rows — the router's turns plus every message sent by or to Ankur. Runs are serialized.

SSE: `router_started` / `router_finished` / `router_failed`. After a route, each thread's `lane_*` and `message` events take over.

## The user is null

No user table. Human messages use `from_agent_id = null` / `to_agent_id = null`; the router shares that identity.

## Dual lanes

Every agent has both lanes. **Reasoning** is the executor (tool-calling against `agent_tools` plus embedded `send_message` / `list_agents` / `wait` / `recall_memory` / `ingest_memory` / `record_thought` / `modify_agent` / `get_agent` / `grant_tool` / `revoke_tool` / `list_tools` / `get_logs` / `yield`). **Conversation** is the control surface (`dispatch_message`, `steer_reasoning`, `list_agents`, `yield`). Speech is only via those message tools — model text is thought, never speech. Reasoning calls Dwar with `tool_choice: "auto"`, so the model can think and write before, alongside, or instead of a tool call; a turn with no tool call continues the lane (a `[continue]` user turn follows it), and a turn ends only on `yield`. Conversation calls with `tool_choice: "any"`: its only outputs are dispatch, steer and yield, and left free it writes replies as plain text that reach no one and never end the lane. `list_agents` looks up kebab-case ids (or lists the roster); it is not grantable. Assembled transcripts stamp each turn `[From: …]` / `[To: …]` (Ankur or an agent id) so multi-party threads stay attributable.

Transcript is in-process and shared. Conversation starts on inbound message, reasoning finish, or `send_message`. `steer_reasoning` queues instructions for the next reasoning step.

Both lanes share one **wake** per agent (`src/runtime/wake.ts`). It starts from the transcript frozen at the wake's first call, then records every step either lane takes, whole and in order: the model turn (thinking, text and tool calls, tagged with the provider and lane that produced it) followed by its tool results, plus messages that arrive mid-wake as one `[Arrived during this wake]` turn. Nothing is cleared or shortened while the wake lasts, and there is no step limit. Each lane sends the whole wake on every call, so conversation sees reasoning's thinking, calls and results (and the reverse); Dwar replays each provider's own turns verbatim and translates the other lane's. Two kinds of turn are private to one lane: steers (reasoning only) and send_message intents (conversation only). A wake lasts while any lane run for the agent is queued or running; when the last one finishes it is dropped, and the next wake starts from the transcript alone. A conversation run that finds nothing new it can see since that lane last yielded in this wake ends without a model call, so wake-ups queued behind a run that already handled them cost nothing. Earlier turns never change mid-wake — Dwar caches the history prefix, so a byte-stable history is what keeps long wakes cheap. A reasoning wake that throws is reported to the agent's parent (Ankur for a root agent) as a `[runtime]` message, which also wakes the parent.

Every Dwar call sends `X-Dadi-Caller` (`hath/<agent id>`, `hath/router`, `hath/attachments`) so Dwar's inference log attributes tokens; `response` logs carry the full usage including cache reads and writes.

Every system prompt starts with the shared system doctrine (`prompts/system.md`), then the charter (the agent's stored prompt), its identity, and its active children. Assembled context always includes a lane block (conversation manages reasoning via `steer_reasoning`, including `terminate` to halt the next tool call; conversation must not claim grants are missing) and an identity/routing block: agent id, parent (or root), point-of-contact messaging for the job, and grant escalation to the parent when the agent is a child. This is prompt guidance only — `send_message` / `dispatch_message` do not enforce it.

## Tools

`src/tools/` is the source of truth; `tools` table is a projection synced at migrate. Grants are parent-to-direct-child only.

### Yaad (memory)

Every reasoning lane holds the two memory tools without a grant, so each agent reads and writes memory itself; there is no memory agent to hand facts to.

| embedded tool | Yaad route | when to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recall_memory` | `POST /recall` | anchor on a `query` (by meaning), `from` node ids, or exact filters (`kind`, `name`, date window, `status`), then walk `hops` links out; `{ from: [id], hops: 1 }` is a node with its neighbors |
| `ingest_memory` | `POST /ingest` | store a fact, event, or scheduled meeting about Ankur's world |

`ingest_memory` sends `source: "agent"`, `agent_id` = the calling agent, and `occurred_at` stamped from the clock, so Yaad records which agent wrote every node. `record_thought` stays separate: it keeps an agent's own working notes (how it did a task, a workaround) and replays them into that agent's context, while facts about Ankur go to Yaad.

| grantable tool | Yaad route | when to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yaad_get_node_history` | `GET /nodes/:id/history` | correction log for one node |
| `yaad_search_history` | `POST /history/search` | semantic search over corrections |

### Chaavi (vault)

Grantable vault tools. Metadata may reach the model; passwords, passkey keys, and secret values never do.

| tool | Chaavi route | when to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chaavi_list_items` | `GET /v1/items` | find a vault item id by name or site uri (`hasPasskey`, no secrets) |
| `chaavi_create_login` | `POST /v1/logins` | create a login with a generated password; never invent or `browser_type` a password |
| `chaavi_fill_login` | `POST /v1/items/:id/login` | type a login into a Nas browser; never `browser_type` a password |
| `chaavi_fill_passkey` | `POST /v1/items/:id/passkey` | load a passkey into the tab's Nas browser virtual authenticator, replacing its previous passkey; call before the site asks for it |
| `chaavi_fill_secret` | `POST /v1/items/:id/secret` | run a host command with the secret in `env_name`; output is redacted |

### Terminal (shell + files)

Thin clients over Nas. Shell is the run-a-command mechanism; file tools are the file-manipulation mechanism — no file IO through the shell by design. Terminal ids are handed off by the spawning agent (prompt or message); Hath does not enforce ownership.

| tool | holder | Nas route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal_spawn` | manager | `POST /terminals`. Optional `terminal_id` starts that session name; omit it for the lowest unused name. A new shell either way. |
| `terminal_list` | manager | `GET /terminals` |
| `terminal_close` | manager | `DELETE /terminals/{id}` |
| `terminal_execute_shell` | worker | `POST /terminals/{id}/exec` |
| `terminal_read` | worker | `GET /terminals/{id}/capture` |
| `terminal_send_keys` | worker | `POST /terminals/{id}/keys` |
| `terminal_read_file` | worker | `POST /fs/read` |
| `terminal_write_file` | worker | `POST /fs/write` |
| `terminal_edit_file` | worker | `POST /fs/edit` |
| `terminal_glob` | worker | `POST /fs/glob` |
| `terminal_grep` | worker | `POST /fs/grep` |

`terminal_execute_shell` HTTP timeout is `timeout_seconds + 10` so the client never gives up before Nas reports a shell timeout. On timeout the command keeps running — use `terminal_read` / `terminal_send_keys` (e.g. `C-c`) to follow up.

File tools take absolute host paths. Nas **denies writes** to OS and dadiOS runtime trees (`/usr`, `/etc`, `$DADI_STATE_DIR/modules`, …); reads are allowed. There is no project sandbox folder. Default terminal/glob/grep cwd is the Nas state dir (dadi home).

### Browser

Each worker drives one Nas Chromium over CDP (`playwright-core` `connectOverCDP`). Playwright resets Chromium's download behavior on connect, so every connection points downloads at the browser's Nas `downloads_dir` (the dadi home's `Downloads`) under their own file names. Act on accessibility refs, not coordinates. `tab_id` is the CDP target id; omit it to use the focused/attached page. Refs from `browser_accessibility_tree` (`e1`, `e2`, …) are valid only until the next snapshot. Screenshots go through Dwar `/image/describe` — pixels never enter the transcript; the raw image is kept in tool `audit` only.

| tool | holder | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_spawn` | manager | Nas `POST /browsers` → `{ browser_id, cdp_url }`. Optional `browser_id` reopens that profile; omit it for the lowest id with no saved Chromium data. |
| `browser_list` | manager | Nas `GET /browsers` |
| `browser_close` | manager | Nas `DELETE` + drop in-process CDP connection |
| `browser_list_tabs` / `browser_new_tab` / `browser_close_tab` | worker | CDP target ids |
| `browser_navigate` | worker | returns `{ url, title }` |
| `browser_accessibility_tree` | worker | bounded tree + refs; truncated flag |
| `browser_click` / `browser_type` / `browser_select` | worker | by ref; `stale_ref` if missing/ambiguous |
| `browser_wait_for` | worker | text, ref, and/or network_idle |
| `browser_upload_file` | worker | absolute host `paths` onto a file input or the chooser a ref opens; CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles` so Chromium reads the host file itself; returns attached names + sizes |
| `browser_screenshot` | worker | `page` (Playwright) or `display` (Nas monitor) → Dwar describe |
| `browser_extract_text` | worker | visible body text, bounded |


### Nas (control plane)

Host ops via Nas HTTP. System logs are Loki (`nas_get_logs`); agent cognition is `get_logs`.

| tool | Nas route |
| --- | --- |
| `nas_get_status` | `GET /status` |
| `nas_get_logs` | `GET /logs` |
| `nas_restart_module` | `POST /modules/{name}/restart` |
| `nas_pull_updates` | `POST /pull_updates` (202, runs in background) |
| `nas_get_update_status` | `GET /pull_updates` |
| `nas_stack_up` | `POST /stack/up` |
| `nas_stack_down` | `POST /stack/down` |
| `nas_provision` | `POST /provision` |
| `nas_list_clients` | `GET /clients` |

### Devices (desktop and phone apps)

Read-only surveys over every enrolled device: each call lists every mesh client from `nas_list_clients` except the box (`os`) with `online`, `last_seen` and `app_running` (a `POST /devices/presence` heartbeat within 45s), and asks only devices with the app running, in parallel, over SSE `device_command` + `POST /devices/commands/:id/result`. Returns `{ devices: [{ node_name, online, last_seen, app_running, result | error }] }`; nothing is pushed to devices.

| tool | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `device_get_info` | platform, OS/app version, timezone |
| `device_get_battery` | percent + charging |
| `device_get_location` | lat/lng/accuracy/timestamp + address when available |
| `device_get_network` | mesh + connection type |

### Hath (meta)

Grantable (a job, not a general rule):

| tool | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `hath_spawn_agent` | create a child (a root when the router calls it); makes an agent a manager |

Embedded in every reasoning lane (never granted, never in the tools table):

| tool | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `modify_agent` | rewrite the prompt or active flag of yourself or a direct child (immutable ids) |
| `grant_tool` / `revoke_tool` | manage a direct child's grants; the router's children are the roots |
| `list_tools` | grantable registry catalog (name + description); optional prefix filter |
| `get_agent` | id, system prompt, parent, active flag, and tool names for self or a direct child (any agent for the router) |
| `get_logs` | audit (`response` / `tool_result` / `message`) for self or a direct child (any named agent for the router, which never reads its own) |
| `schedule_message` / `list_schedules` / `cancel_schedule` | durable schedules sent from and owned by the caller, so every agent automates its own work; not the router's |

## CLI

The host `dadi` CLI lives in Nas (`service/cmd/dadi`, `/usr/bin/dadi` on the appliance). It invokes this registry over HTTP (`GET /tools`, `POST /tools/:name/execute`). Requires `HATH_URL` (no default). Execute runs as the user unless a caller identity is given: `--as-agent <kebab-id>` or `--as-router`. Agent callers must be active and hold a grant for the tool. `as_agent_id: "router"` is limited to the router's tools (`hath_spawn_agent`, `grant_tool`, `revoke_tool`, `get_agent`, `get_logs`, `list_tools`). Embedded tools can be executed by name too; agents need no grant for them. Omitting `as_agent_id` runs as the user: any tool, no grant or active check (human / ops).

## Persistence

`agents`, `agent_logs`, `messages`, and `scheduled_messages` survive restart. `messages` is the source of truth for human↔agent chat and the rolling lane transcript (at least the last `[runtime].transcript_window_messages` turns, default 40; the window's start advances in steps of `transcript_window_step_messages` so the cached prefix survives new messages). Older turns remain in `agent_logs` / `hath_get_logs`. Each `agent_logs` row is one of: `response` — one model call's full output (`provider`, `stop_reason`, `usage`, and `content` blocks in provider order: `thinking` / `redacted_thinking`, `text`, `tool_use`), written before its tools run; `tool_result` — one tool's outcome (`tool_use_id`, `name`, `content`, `is_error`, plus audit fields such as `browser_id`); `message` — a delivered message. Wakes, locks, steer/intent queues, host `sessions`, and the event stream do not survive. Single-process only — do not run replicas sharing the DB and expecting lane serialization.

Schedule tools (`schedule_message`, `list_schedules`, `cancel_schedule`) persist one-shot and recurring deliveries; the in-process scheduler ticks from `[schedule].tick_seconds` in `config.toml` (wall clock is the box's zone from the required `TZ`, which Nas writes from `/etc/localtime`).

## Routes

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | `{ "status": "ok", "started_at": "<iso>" }` — process identity only; not a chat epoch |
| `POST` | `/router` | Ankur → router: runs the router lane until it yields; returns the messages it sent |
| `POST` | `/messages` | user → agent; images described via Dwar |
| `GET` | `/threads` | human↔agent conversation summaries |
| `GET` | `/agents/:id/messages` | durable human-thread messages (`since_seq`, `limit`) |
| `GET` | `/events` | SSE live events; no replay |
| `GET` | `/agents` | all agents + `running` + `sessions` |
| `GET` | `/agents/:id` | agent, children, grants |
| `GET` | `/agents/:id/logs` | per-agent audit trail |
| `GET` | `/agents/:id/schedules` | every schedule the agent sends or receives, next run first |
| `PATCH` | `/schedules/:id` | hand edit as Ankur: any of `run_at` (future, with offset), `interval_minutes` (null for one-shot), `content` |
| `DELETE` | `/schedules/:id` | cancel a schedule as Ankur |
| `GET` | `/logs` | cross-agent audit trail |
| `GET` | `/tools` | grantable tool catalog |
| `GET` | `/tools/:name` | one tool schema |
| `POST` | `/tools/:name/execute` | run tool as `as_agent_id` (kebab-case id or `"router"`; omitted = user) |

Unknown request fields are a 422. No CORS — clients use Tauri HTTP (or equivalent) outside the browser sandbox.
