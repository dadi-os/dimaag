/**
 * One agent's shared lane history for the current wake.
 *
 * Both lanes read the same record: the transcript frozen when the wake began,
 * then every step either lane took — each model turn whole (thinking, text,
 * tool calls, in provider order) followed by its tool results — plus messages
 * that arrived mid-wake. Nothing is dropped or shortened while the wake lasts.
 * Only two kinds of turn are lane-private: steers (reasoning's instructions)
 * and intents (conversation's delivery requests), because the other lane
 * already sees the tool call that produced them.
 *
 * A wake lasts while any lane run for the agent is queued or running, so a
 * steer from conversation reaches a reasoning run that still sees the steer's
 * call. When the last run releases, the record is dropped and the next wake
 * starts from the transcript alone — prior steps cannot few-shot it.
