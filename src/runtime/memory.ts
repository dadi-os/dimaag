Filters match exactly: `kind`, `name` (exact title or alias), `occurred_from`/`occurred_to` (a date window, e.g. "what\'s on Tuesday"), `status` (plans). Filters narrow a query; `from` cannot be combined with filters. `hops` walks that many links out from where you started — `{ from: [id], hops: 1 }` is a node and everything linked to it. Returned edges carry their properties. With a query, check `sufficient`: false means memory did not have enough, so say so rather than filling the gap.',

Yaad extracts the people, places, plans, and links and reconciles them with what is already stored, but send only what is new or changed since you last stored it: re-sending a whole report can still duplicate what is there, so recall_memory first when unsure. Keep each call to one topic and a handful of facts. Give every deadline and event its exact date, time, and time zone, and say \"time not stated\" when the source gives none rather than guessing one. To correct something stored earlier, say so outright: \"Correction: <old claim> is wrong; <new claim>.\" A fact you simply leave out is not removed. Do not store progress or status that is about to change — what you checked, what is not posted yet, what is still to do — and label a snapshot you do store (a gradebook) \"as of <date>\". Your own working notes — how you did a task, paths, branches, credentials, how a site behaves — belong in record_thought, not here.
