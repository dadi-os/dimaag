 * conversation's steps, and mid-wake arrivals — and the model is free to think
 * and write before or instead of calling a tool. A turn with no tool call
 * continues; the only clean exit is the embedded yield tool.
 *
 * Steers join the wake as reasoning-only turns where they happened. When
 * conversation sets terminate, this wake stops in its tracks: no further tool
 * calls run (in-flight model output is logged, then its calls are refused).
